Max Path Sum in Binary Tree

Given binary tree, return the max path sum.

Sample input:
        1
   2        3
4    5    6   7

Sample output: 18 (sum(5,2,1,3,7))

    Time complexity: O(n), n=number of nodes, since traversal covers all n nodes.
    Space complexity: O(log(n)), or that it's proportional to the depth of the tree.
        If we have a relatively balanced tree, then O(log(n)) is an average.
        If we have a very unbalanced tree (worst case), like a linked list, 
        then space complexity is O(n), since there will be n calls on the recursive call stack.
