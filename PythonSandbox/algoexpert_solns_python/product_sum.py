Product Sum

Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum. 
A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other "special" arrays. 
The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special" arrays inside it 
should be summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth. 
For example, the product sum of [x, y] is x + y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2y + 2z.

Sample input: [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]
Sample output: 12 (5 + 2 + 2 * (7 - 1) + 3 + 2 * (6 + 3 * (-13 + 8) + 4))
