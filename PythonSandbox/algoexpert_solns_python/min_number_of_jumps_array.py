'''
Minimum number of jumps in an array

Given an array of ints, each int represents the max number of jumps forward from the int's index. 
Write function to figure out the miniumum number of jumps to get from the 0th index to the final index.

Sample input: [3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3]
Sample output: 4
    (3 --> 4 --> 3 --> 7 --> 3)
    (3 --> 2 --> 2 --> 7 --> 3)

    Space complexity: O(n) because of the aux array that stores n solutions.
