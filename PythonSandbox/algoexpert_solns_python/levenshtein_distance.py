"""
Function that takes 2 strings, return the minimum number of edit
operations that need to be performed on the 1st string to get the 2nd string.
Valid operations are: insertion, deletion, substitution, of a character.

Sample input: "abc", "yabd"
Sample output: 2 (insert "y", subsitute "c" for "d")
